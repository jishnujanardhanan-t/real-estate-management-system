#  Real Estate 360 – Salesforce Application

Real Estate 360 is a Salesforce-based application designed to manage property listings, offers, visits, and commissions using a combination of **Salesforce Admin configuration** and **Developer tools (Apex, Triggers, LWC)**.  
This project demonstrates real-world Salesforce development practices, including data modeling, automation, custom UI, reporting, and testing.

- Properties and sellers
- Buyer offers
- Property visits
- Agent commissions
- Automation and analytics

This project is intended as a **portfolio project for a Salesforce Developer**.

##  Automation & Development

###  Apex & Triggers
Bulk-safe Apex architecture using:
- Trigger Handler Pattern
- Selector Classes
- Service Classes

**Implemented Logic:**
- Validate Offer Amount ≥ Property Price
- Auto-update Property Status to *Under Offer*
- Auto-increment Total Visits when a visit is created

---

###  Lightning Web Component (LWC)

**Component:** `propertyList`

**Features:**
- Displays property records in a custom UI
- Filters by:
  - Property Status
  - Property Type
  - Price Range
- Shows seller name instead of ID
- Real-time data loading via Apex Controller

This demonstrates **custom UI development** beyond standard Lightning App Builder capabilities.

###  Salesforce Flow

**Flow:** Notify Seller on New Offer

- Type: Record-Triggered Flow
- Triggered when a new Offer__c is created
- Automatically sends an email notification to the seller (Account)
- Demonstrates declarative automation alongside Apex

---

##  Reports & Dashboards

**Reports Created:**
- Properties by Status
- Properties by Type
- Total Visits per Property

**Dashboard:**
- Visual representation of property distribution and engagement

---

##  Testing

- Apex Test Classes created for all Apex logic
- All tests pass successfully
- Bulk-safe test data created using `@testSetup`
- Code coverage meets Salesforce deployment standards

> Note: Test data created in test classes does not persist in the org, as Salesforce runs tests in an isolated context.
